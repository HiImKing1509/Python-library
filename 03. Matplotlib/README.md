- Matplotlib is a library used in Python for graphical representation to understand the data before moving it to data-processing and training it for Machine learning purposes. It uses python GUI toolkits to produce graphs and plots using object-oriented APIs. The Matplotlib also provides a MATLAB-like interface so that a user can do similar tasks as MATLAB. This library is free and open-source and has many extension interfaces that extend matplotlib API to various other libraries.

| **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
| ---- | --- |
| It helps produce plots that are configurable, powerful, and accurate | Matplotlib has a strong dependency on NumPy and other such libraries for the SciPy stack
| Matplotlib can be easily streamlined with Jupyter Notebook | It has a high learning curve as the use of Matplotlib takes quite a lot of knowledge and application from the learnersâ€™ end
| It supports GUI toolkits that include wxPython, Qt, and Tkinter | There can be confusion for developers because Matplotlib provides two distinct frameworks: Object-oriented and MATLAB
| Matplotlib is leveraged with a structure that can support Python as well as IPython shells | Matplotlib is a library used for data visualization. It is not suitable for data analysis. To get both data visualization and analysis, we will have to integrate it with other libraries
