- One of widely used Pythonâ€™s Machine Learning library is Pandas. Pandas is the best Python library that is majorly used for data manipulation. It uses handy and descriptive data structures such as DataFrames to create programs for implementing functions. Developed on top of NumPy, it is a quick and easier-to-use library.
- Pandas provides data reading and writing capabilities using various sources such as Excel, HDFS, and many more. If you are planning on a use case for a real-world Machine Learning model, then, sooner or later, you would use Pandas for implementing it.

> Some of the great features of Pandas when it comes to handling data are:
> 
> * Dataset reshaping and pivoting
> 
> * Merging and joining of datasets
> 
> * Handling of missing data and data alignment
> 
> * Various indexing options such as Hierarchical axis indexing, Fancy indexing
> 
> * Data filtration options

| **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
| ---- | --- |
| It has descriptive, quick, and compliant data structures | It is based on Matplotlib, which means that an inexperienced programmer needs to be acquainted with both libraries to understand which one will be better to solve a specific business problem
| It supports operations such as grouping, integrating, iterating, re-indexing, and representing data | Pandas is much less suitable for quantitative modeling and n-dimensional arrays. In such scenarios, where we need to work on quantitative/statistical modeling, we can use Numpy or SciPy
| The Pandas library is very flexible for usage in association with other libraries
| It contains inherent data manipulation functionalities that can be implemented using minimal commands
| It can be implemented in a large variety of areas, especially related to business and education, due to its optimized performance
