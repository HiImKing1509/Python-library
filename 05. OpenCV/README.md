> `OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)` is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

## Features of OpenCV Library

### Using OpenCV library, you can âˆ’
> Read and write images
> 
> Capture and save videos
> 
> Process images (filter, transform)
> 
> Perform feature detection
> 
> Detect specific objects such as faces, eyes, cars, in the videos or images.
> 
> Analyze the video, i.e., estimate the motion in it, subtract the background, and track objects in it.

`OpenCV` was originally developed in C++. In addition to it, Python and Java bindings were provided. `OpenCV` runs on various Operating Systems such as windows, Linux, OSx, FreeBSD, Net BSD, Open BSD, etc.

## OpenCV Library Modules

Following are the main library modules of the OpenCV library.

### Core Functionality
> This module covers the basic data structures such as Scalar, Point, Range, etc., that are used to build OpenCV applications. In addition to these, it also includes the multidimensional array Mat, which is used to store the images. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name `org.opencv.core`.

### Image Processing
> This module covers various image processing operations such as image filtering, geometrical image transformations, color space conversion, histograms, etc. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name `rg.opencv.imgproc`.

### Video
> This module covers the video analysis concepts such as motion estimation, background subtraction, and object tracking. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name `org.opencv.video`.

### Video I/O
> This module explains the video capturing and video codecs using OpenCV library. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name `org.opencv.videoio`.

### calib3d
> This module includes algorithms regarding basic multiple-view geometry algorithms, single and stereo camera calibration, object pose estimation, stereo correspondence and elements of 3D reconstruction. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name `org.opencv.calib3d`.

### features2d
> This module includes the concepts of feature detection and description. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name `org.opencv.features2d`.

### Objdetect
> This module includes the detection of objects and instances of the predefined classes such as faces, eyes, mugs, people, cars, etc. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name `org.opencv.objdetect`.

### Highgui
> This is an easy-to-use interface with simple UI capabilities. In the Java library of OpenCV, the features of this module is included in two different packages namely, `org.opencv.imgcodecs` and `org.opencv.videoio`.

## A Brief History of OpenCV
OpenCV was initially an Intel research initiative to advise CPU-intensive applications. It was officially launched in 1999.

* In the year 2006, its first major version, OpenCV 1.0 was released.
* In October 2009, the second major version, OpenCV 2 was released.
* In August 2012, OpenCV was taken by a nonprofit organization OpenCV.org.
