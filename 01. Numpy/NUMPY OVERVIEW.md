- NumPy is regarded as being one of the most widely used and best Python libraries for Machine Learning. Other libraries, such as TensorFlow and Keras, use NumPy to implement various operations on tensors.
- Created on the top of an older library Numeric, the Numpy is used for handling multi-dimensional data and intricate mathematical functions. Numpy is a fast computational library that can handle tasks and functions ranging from basic algebra to even Fourier transforms, random simulations, and shape manipulations. This library is written in C language, which gives it an edge over standard python built-in sequencing. Numpy arrays are better than pandas series in the term of indexing and Numpy works better if the number of records is less than 50k. The NumPy arrays are loaded into a single CPU which can cause slowness in processing over the new alternatives like Tensorflow, Dask, or JAX, but still, the learning of Numpy is very easy and it is one of the most popular libraries to enter into the Machine Learning world.

> Few of the points in favor of NumPy are:
>
>  * Support for mathematical and logical operations
> 
> * Shape manipulation
> 
> * Sorting and Selecting capabilities
> 
> * Discrete Fourier transformations
> 
> * Basic linear algebra and statistical operations
> 
> * Random simulations
> 
> * Support for n-dimensional arrays

| **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
| ---- | --- |
| Using NumPy, we can easily deal with multi-dimensional data | NumPy is highly dependent on non-Pythonic entities. It uses the functionalities of Cython and other libraries that use C/C++ | 
| The library helps in the matrix manipulation of the data and the operations such as transpose, reshape, and many more | Its high productivity comes at a price |
| NumPy enables enhanced performance and the management of garbage collection as it provides a dynamic data structure | The data types are hardware-native and not Python-native, so it costs heavily when we want to translate NumPy entities back to Python-equivalent entities and vice versa |
| It allows us to improve the performance of the Machine Learning model | |
